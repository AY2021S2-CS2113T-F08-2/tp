## Overview
HealthVault is an hospital information recording system targetted for nurses. HealthVault is a desktop app for managing doctor, nurse, patient and inventory information, optimised for use through the command line interface. A user with fast typing skills would be able to navigate through the application with ease and at greater efficiency as compared to a normal database application. The program is written entirely in Java.
